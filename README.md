# QuickDeploy

QuickDeploy is a simple, instant about:blank iframe opener that works any platform, with simplistic fetures, and troubleshoting and diagnosticts baked right in. 

## What Dose It Work With?

We work with many sites that alow for a full page embed, however, if the site you want to cloak dose not have that option, there are some workarounds.

One common workaround is using a proxy like [Ultravilot](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet) Or [Scramjet](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/scramjet), and by properley deploying it.
Currentaly the site is preload with a updated version of Raduis (soon to be Nova) which is a modern web proxy that works with most websites. You can find our official site at https://studyworkandmore.uk or at our [repo!](https://github.com/sriail/Radius)
